We are a short training programme for students of all levels with a goal of introducing students to a broad range of topics in linguistics. 

These 5-week courses will run across all three terms and are free to attend and open to everyone. Whether you're accompanying your MA studies or just looking to dive deeper into these fascinating areas, we've got you covered.
